# concertmate_fe

### Abstract
- This application authenticates the user through Spotify API to access the user's top listening artists after login. In the create event page, the user is able to select one of their artists, and see a list of upcoming shows (if any) from the TicketMaster API. Once the user makes a selection of which show to create the event for, the user can create that event to invite friends.

*Challenges*
1. Working with TicketMaster API to get artist shows information
2. Communicating timeline with Back-End
